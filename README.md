# Problem-1
Caesar Cipher
=============

To run the test, just press Run on the editor (for Example: F11 in Eclipse Neon).

When the program is running, first it will ask you to input how many shifts you want for the alphabets to be shifted in the Caesar Cipher.
The input of the shift is an integer, and it will be validated, so the input must be around 0 to 26. If the input is less than 0 or more than 26, it will keep looping until it gets the right input.
After inputting the shift value, the program will ask to type in the text that about to be encrypted. There is no restriction for the length of the text or what characters you should input, but it has a validation which allows it to keep looping if the text is still empty.
After inputting the text that about to be encrypted, the program will convert the text to the encrypted version based on how many shifts that you have already input to the program. Symbols and numbers will not be converted, it will remain the same as the inputted text.
